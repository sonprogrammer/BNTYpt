## Pages




## troubleshooting  üî´
1. The Outlet was not applied in the LayoutPage, so the child components are not rendered.
2. A conflict occurred during npm's dependency resolution process -> use the --legacy-peer-deps flag.
3. when navigating from landing page to main page after logging in, the state is empty. i used `window.location.href='/browse` , but this caused the browser to refresh. so recoil state is reset. to fix it i used `useNavigate` from react router dom. 
4.images were stored in local when i post some photos. so i used Cloudinary



## Impressions
as i worked on everything by myself, like function, design planning. actually, i planned roughly, so i keep changing my plans because of the ambitous which led to changes function and design, this cause me to miss deadline. so i realized again that initial plan is important.
